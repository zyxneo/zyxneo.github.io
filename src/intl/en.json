My task was to continue and finish it.</li><li>The professional design was also created by the agency, but as Developer I was having some freedom to design, how the page should behave in different screen resolutions, how it should react on the user actions, how elements should be animated. Because of the high amount of users many device was supported, and the developers should take care, that the page design fits to all of them in any conditions, like e.g.: the dropdown menu should also work within an overlay on a small mobile screen even if there is no space left, or the items can not be scrolled.</li><li>Because of my experience in the gaming industry I was having the task to implement the games into the frontend.
