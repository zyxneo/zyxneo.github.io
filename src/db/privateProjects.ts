    description: 'My very first website from 2006. I make it from my own, without any help. I learned flash, I made all the photos, even the guestbook. I tried to take care on smallest details, to translate it, and to make it a worthy portfolio for Judit. I also programmed the slider. Now i recognize that I also programmed basic error handling :) It is always a nice to have. I think, I have take the advantage of animation in flash properly, plus the interactivity, the matching music (3-5 track) So it was a "full stack" project, with the first "internet learnings".',

But in that time there was only books, or payed programs available. I was boring to copy the text from the books, so I decided to create a textinput in flash, which compares the string I write with the correct one. Than I highlighted the errors. Than displayed statistic and so on. So I was not learning anymore, but started to program. I liked it so much, that I published it on the net, so anyone could using it. It had a toplist too. Later it turned out, that the way it works is "not optimal" for the server. So I wrote a new version of it. And a new again, I think the fourth one was the one online the longest time. Based on the feedbacks people loved it, so it is still online, even if flash is death sine that. It has so many hidden features, that sometime it can suprise me too.',
